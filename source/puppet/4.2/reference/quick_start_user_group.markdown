## Create the User and Group

Puppet uses some defaults for unspecified user and group attributes, so all you'll need to do to create a new user and group is set the 'ensure' attribute to 'present'. This 'present' value tells Puppet to check if the resource exists on the system, and to create the specified resource if it does not.

1. On your Puppet master, run `puppet apply -e "user { 'jargyle': ensure => present, }"`. The result should show, in part, `Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/User[jargyle]/ensure: created`.

2. On your Puppet master, run `puppet apply -e "group { 'web': ensure => present, }"`. The result should show, in part, `Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Group[web]/ensure: created`.

> That's it! You've successfully created the Puppet user `jargyle` and the Puppet group `web`. 

## Add the Group to the Main Manifest

(Intro)

1. From the CLI of your Puppet master, run `puppet resource -e group web`. It should return the following Puppet code in the form of a file in your text editor:

			group { 'web':
  			  ensure => 'present',
  			  gid    => '502',
			}
			
	>**Note**: Your GID (the group ID) may not be the exact same number shown in this guide.
			
2. Copy the code, then save and exit the file.

3. Navigate to your main manifest (`cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests`).

4. Paste the code you got from running `puppet resource -e group web` into the default node of `site.pp`, then save and exit.

5. From the CLI of your Puppet master, run `puppet parser validate site.pp` to ensure that there are no errors. The parser will return nothing if there are no errors. 

6. From the CLI of your Puppet agent, use `puppet agent -t` to trigger a Puppet run.

> That's it! You've successfully added your group, `web`, to the main manifest.

## Add the User to the Main Manifest

1. From the CLI of your Puppet master, run `puppet resource -e user jargyle`. It should return the following Puppet code in the form of a file in your text editor:

			user { 'jargyle':
 			  ensure           => 'present',
			  gid              => '501',
			  home             => '/home/jargyle',
			  password         => '!!',
			  password_max_age => '99999',
			  password_min_age => '0',
			  shell            => '/bin/bash',
			  uid              => '501',
			}

	>**Note**: Your uid (the user ID), or gid (the group ID) may not be the exact same number shown in this guide.

8. Edit the file by adding the following Puppet code to it:

			comment           => 'Judy Argyle',
			groups            => 'web',

9. **Delete** the following Puppet code from the jargyle user:

			  gid              => '501',
		
10. Copy all of the code, then save and exit the file.

11. Paste the code you got after editing `puppet resource -e user jargyle` into your default node in `site.pp`. It should look like this:

			user { 'jargyle':
 			  ensure           => 'present',
			  home             => '/home/jargyle',
			  comment           => 'Judy Argyle',
			  groups            => 'web',
			  password         => '!!',
			  password_max_age => '99999',
			  password_min_age => '0',
			  shell            => '/bin/bash',
			  uid              => '501',
			}

12. From the CLI of your Puppet master, run `puppet parser validate site.pp` to ensure that there are no errors. The parser will return nothing if there are no errors. 

13. From the CLI of your Puppet agent, use `puppet agent -t` to trigger a Puppet run.

> Success! You have created a user, `jargyle`, and added jargyle to the group with `groups => web`.
